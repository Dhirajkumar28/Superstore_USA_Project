Furthermore, we identified the customers who generated the highest and lowest sales and the number of states where the business is located and lastly, we observed patterns in the months when orders were placed.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. It is important to ensure that popular items such as phones, chairs, storage, tables, and binder sets are always available and not out of stock.

2. It is advisable to have technology and furniture products readily accessible for customers.

3. In order to stimulate increased purchases, it would be beneficial to offer a discount that is accessible during the holiday season.

4. The advertisements and campaigns should be targeted to prioritize those residing in the top 10 most performing cities.

5. Additionally, discounts should be offered for the least performing products to entice customers to order them.
